I am committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. And I am actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of this website and in doing so adhere to many of the available standards and guidelines.

This website endeavours to conform to level Double-A of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1. It has been built using code compliant with W3C standards for HTML and CSS. The site displays correctly in current browsers and using standards compliant HTML/CSS code means any future browsers will also display it correctly.

This Web site has been built from scratch. I have prioritized accessibility in every step of the design and development phases.

And if you experience any difficulty in accessing any area of the website, please donâ€™t hesitate to [contact me](https://mastodon.ie/@abban).
